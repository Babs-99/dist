      <p id="bioBody">
        Babalola Awe, known as Trill Xoe, got into music production at 15 via
        his senior in secondary school, who introduced him to Fruity Loops and
        taught him some basics.
        Trill Xoe
        started as a Hip-Hop producer before leaving Nigeria for university on
        the island of Mauritius, where his closest friends were from various
        parts of Africa and was thus exposed to different African sounds.
        This, along with the rising "alte" scene back home, inspired Trill to
        push himself to improve his range of production. Trill Xoe is working hard to
        place himself as one of the most diverse African producers right now.
